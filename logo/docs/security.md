# Security Guidelines for channelGold (CHG)

## Overview
Security is a top priority for the channelGold (CHG) project. This document outlines our approach to maintaining a safe ecosystem, protecting token holders, and ensuring transparency across all development activities.

---

## Smart Contract Security
The CHG token and its related contracts are deployed on the Solana network, which provides high-performance and secure infrastructure.

### Key principles:
- Immutable smart contract logic once deployed  
- No hidden minting functions  
- No backdoor access to user funds  
- Transparent and verifiable contract source code  

We recommend that all users verify contract addresses from official sources before interacting with the token.

## User Safety Recommendations
To maintain personal security and protect CHG assets, users should follow these best practices:

### **1. Verify Official Links**
Always access:
- Official website  
- Verified social media accounts  
- Official GitHub repository  

Avoid interacting with unknown links or suspicious DApps.

---

### **2. Keep Your Wallet Secure**
- Never share your seed phrase or private keys  
- Use reputable wallets (e.g., Phantom)  
- Enable 2FA when possible  
- Keep software and extensions updated  

---

### **3. Watch for Scams**
Be cautious about:
- Fake airdrops  
- Impersonation accounts  
- Messages asking for personal wallet information  

CHG team will *never* ask for private keys.

---

## Liquidity and Transparency Policies

### **Locked Liquidity**
The project may lock liquidity to increase trust and reduce risk of manipulation.  
Any liquidity lock will be publicly announced and verifiable.

---

### **No Hidden Token Taxes**
The CHG token architecture does **not** include:
- Hidden transfer fees  
- Developer withdrawal mechanisms  
- Unannounced token minting  

Transparency remains a core principle.

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a bug, vulnerability, or security concern, please report it confidentially through our official channels.

### Reports should include:
- Description of the issue  
- How it can be reproduced  
- Potential impact  

Responsible disclosure is encouraged to help maintain a secure environment.

## Disclaimer
The CHG project operates transparently, but users should always perform their own research and exercise caution when interacting with blockchain systems.
