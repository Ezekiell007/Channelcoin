# Staking Guidelines for channelGold (CHG)

## Overview
Staking is a key feature of the channelGold (CHG) ecosystem, allowing holders to lock their tokens and earn rewards over time. This mechanism supports network stability, encourages long-term participation, and creates additional utility for the token.

---

## Objectives of Staking
- Reward long-term holders  
- Strengthen liquidity stability  
- Increase engagement within the ecosystem  
- Support future governance and ecosystem expansion  

---

## Staking Types
channelGold currently supports the following staking model:

### **1. Variable Rewards Staking**
CHG holders can stake their tokens and receive rewards based on network performance and staking pool conditions.

**Key features:**
- Rewards adjust dynamically  
- No fixed APY  
- Encourages early and long-term participation  
- Supports ecosystem sustainability  

---

## How Staking Works
1. The user locks CHG tokens into the staking contract or approved platform.  
2. Rewards accumulate over time based on the current reward rate.  
3. The user can withdraw both the rewards and the staked tokens after the unlock period (if any).  
4. Staking terms may evolve as the ecosystem grows.
